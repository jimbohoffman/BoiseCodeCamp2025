       "  'Once enough points accumulated, one of these special unitswould be born in your city. If your city had focused on artists, youmight end up with Beethoven.

       "  \"From these humblebeginnings you will build a new city, creating workers toimprove the land, scouts to explore the world, settlers to buildnew cities, and warriors to protect what's yours.

       "  \"Under your guidance your citizens will learn how to construct tools and weapons of bronze and how to domesticate wild ani-mals.They'll learn how to read and write, how to sail on theoceans, how to harvest metals from beneath the earth. Y ourcities will begin to expand, filled with barracks, libraries andtemples. Eventually your people will discover the compass, the printing press, and gunpowder. Their railroads will cross the country,while their mighty frigates dominate the world's oceans\",\n",
       "  \"Eventually their military will battle with their neighbors notwith muskets and cannon, but with rifles, artillery, bombers andbattleships - and perhaps someday with tanks, stealth bombersand nukes! By game's end they'll have achieved all of the won-ders of the 21st century – and more! If they survive, that is.And that's up to you.In fact, pretty much everything is up to you.

WORLD SIZE After you have selected a map-type, you next choose the sizeworld on which you will play.World sizes run from “Duel” to“Huge.” The size of the world will have important effects on the game.

       "  'As a general rule, the larger the world, the longer the game will take to complete. Civilizations will be larger and thus takemore effort to conquer.

(In other words, you play it just like chess or Risk.)Y ou can take as long as you want to complete your turn. Multiplayer games can be played this way, as well',\n",
       "  'Multiplayer games can be played this way, as well. However in a multiplayer game you can use a “Turn Timer” to limit theamount of time each player has to make his move. (See theadvanced section on “Multiplayer Games,” page 172, for moreinformation.) SIMULTANEOUS TURNS GAMES During a simultaneous turn game (available only during mul-tiplayer games), you and your opponents take your turns simul-taneously. Everybody moves units, manipulates cities, conductsdiplomacy and so forth at the same time',\n",

This allows each city to access all spaces within their “city radius”(see below) with little or no overlap. • T o obstruct other civilizations',\n",

Cities built near to the capital city suffer little fromcorruption, while distant cities suffer greatly. 46COUNTERING CORRUPTION The distance penalty can be countered in a number of fash-ions. The “National Property” civic removes the distancepenalty entirely',\n",
       "  'The “courthouse” building decreases corrup-tion in the city where it is built.The Versailles and ForbiddenPalace wonders cause their cities to become additional centersof government, greatly decreasing corruption in themselvesand surrounding cities. Trade International trade routes are traced from your capital city tothe other civ’s capital city. If that path is blocked, the two civscannot engage in trade',\n",
       "  'Further, your resources must be con-nected via trade route to your capital to be able to be tradedwith other civs. Likewise, your cities gain the benefit ofresources acquired from trade only if they are connected to thecapital. Changing Your Capital Y ou can move your capital from the original city to another bybuilding a Palace in the new city. Upon completion, the orig-inal Palace disappears and the new city becomes your nation’scapital',\n",

CAPTURING CITIES Y ou can capture barbarian cities or cities belonging to civiliza-tions that you are at war with.T o do so you must enter the citywith a military unit; this usually involves destroying the enemyunits defending the city.When you capture an enemy city youhave the option of destroying the city or installing a new gov-ernor',\n",
       "  'If you choose to destroy the city, it and everything itcontains is done away with. If you choose to install a new gov- ernor, the captured city will usually go through several turns of“resistance” (see following) before joining your civilization.

       "  'A foreign city that has been under a lotof cultural pressure from your civilization will tend to spendless time in resistance,as will a city that shares your civilization’sreligion. A large, established foreign city with a lot of cultureand a different religion will resist longer. Y ou cannot do much to shorten the duration of resistance once it is in progress',\n",
       "  'However once the resistance ends youcan lessen the chances of the city returning to that state bypassing your state religion to that city and building temples andsuch, and by raising the city’s culture and reducing any outsidecultural pressure on that city.
